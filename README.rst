Aldryn News & Blog for django CMS
=================================

Continuation of the deprecated project `Divio Aldryn News&Blog <https://github.com/divio/aldryn-newsblog>`_.

Aldryn News & Blog is an `Aldryn <http://aldryn.com>`_-compatible news and
weblog application for `django CMS <http://django-cms.org>`_.

**Content editors** looking for documentation on how to use the editing
interface should refer to our `user manual`_ section.

**Django developers** who want to learn more about django CMS, as well as
how to install, configure and customize it for their own projects should
refer to the `documentation`_ sections.

Aldryn News & Blog is intended to serve as a model of good practice for
development of django CMS and Aldryn applications.
